#
# Python allows us to define lists by comprehension.
# This means we can create a list without indicating
# each one of its elements.
#
# For example: if we want a list of even numbers
# from 0 to 10, we can do:
#
# 	a_list = [x for x in range(0, 11, 2)]
#
# Another way to do the same:
#
#	a_list = [x*2 for x in range(0, 6)]
#
# Print a list of even numbers from 1 to 20 created
# by comprehension
