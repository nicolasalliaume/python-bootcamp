# Tuples provides a functionaloty called packing 
# and unpacking, which allows you to split a given 
# tuple into multiple variables and vice versa.
#
# To unpack:
#
#	var1, var2, var3 = the_tuple 
#		# the_tuple is (val1, val2, val3)
#
# To pack:
#	the_tuple = val1, val2, val3
#
# Unpack the given tuple and print the three 
# resulting variables. Then, pack the three 
# variables into a new tuple and print it.
