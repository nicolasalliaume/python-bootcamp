# Files are extremely easy to work with in Python.
# A file can be opened using 'open()' and passing
# the file's path and an open mode ('a', 'w', ...)
#
# Then it can be written using 'write()', and closed
# using 'close()'.
#
# Write the given content into a file (open, write 
# and close), and then read it and print it's contents.
