Monty Python (sometimes known as The Pythons) are a British 
surreal comedy group that created Monty Python's Flying Circus, a 
British television comedy sketch show that first aired on the BBC 
on 5 October 1969. Forty-five episodes were made over four series. 
The Python phenomenon developed from the television series into 
something larger in scope and impact, spawning touring stage shows, 
films, numerous albums, several books and a stage musical as well 
as launching the members to individual stardom. The group's influence 
on comedy has been compared to The Beatles' influence on music.

The television series, broadcast by the BBC from 1969 to 1974, was 
conceived, written and performed by members Graham Chapman, John Cleese, 
Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin. Loosely 
structured as a sketch show, but with an innovative stream-of-consciousness 
approach (aided by Gilliam's animation), it pushed the boundaries 
of what was acceptable in style and content. A self-contained 
comedy team responsible for both writing and performing their work, 
the Pythons had creative control which allowed them to experiment 
with form and content, discarding rules of television comedy. Their 
influence on British comedy has been apparent for years, while in 
North America it has coloured the work of cult performers from the 
early editions of Saturday Night Live through to more recent absurdist 
trends in television comedy. "Pythonesque" has entered the English 
lexicon as a result.
